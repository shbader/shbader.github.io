Welcome! My name is Shujaut and I am a fluid dynamicist currently working as a postdoctoral associate with Prof. Daniel J. Bodony at the Center for Hypersonics and Entry Systems Studies (CHESS) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. At CHESS, I contribute towards the development of the state-of-the-art simulation and modeling tools to predict and study the thermo-poro-elastic response of Thermal Protection Systems (TPS) in high-enthalphy flow conditions during re-entry.  

Prior to this, I was hosted by Dr. Xiaojue Zhu as a Humboldt Postdoctoral Fellow in the Computational Flow Physics and Data Assimilation (ComFyDA) group at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) in Germany, where I developed a conservative, second-order finite difference solver for cartesian dynamos driven by Rayleigh BÃ©nard convection (RBC). Additionally, I worked on the physics of thermal/magneto-convective flows relevant in various geophysical and astrophysical contexts. 

Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering with minors in Astrophysics and Applied Scientific Computing from Iowa State University under the supervision of Prof. Paul Durbin. 

### **Research Interests**
My research interests lie at the intersection of the theoretical/computational fluid dynamics, applied physics, and computational physics, with particular emphasis on the following areas: 

1. Turbulence simulation and modeling (Hybrid RANS/LES and subgrid methods)
2. Thermal/Magneto-convection and magnetohydrodynamics
3. Hypersonics and compressible flows
