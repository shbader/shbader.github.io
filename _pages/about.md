Welcome! I am Shujaut Bader. I am a fluid dynamicist currently working as a postdoctoral associate with Prof. Daniel J. Bodony at the Center for Hypersonics and Entry Systems Studies (CHESS) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. At CHESS, I contribute towards the development of a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method based numerical tools to study and predict the thermo-poro-elastic material-response in elastic solid Thermal Protection System (TPS) materials. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of fluid dynamics, applied physics, and computational physics, with particular emphasis on the following areas: 

1. Turbulence simulation and modeling (Hybrid RANS/DES and subgrid methods)
2. Magnetoconvection and magnetohydrodyhamics
3. Thermal convection
4. Hypersonics and compressible flows
