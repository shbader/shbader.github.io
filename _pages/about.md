Welcome! I am Shujaut Bader. I am a fluid dynamicist currently working as a postdoctoral associate with Prof. Daniel J. Bodony at the Center for Hypersonics and Entry Systems Studies (CHESS) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. At CHESS, I contribute towards the development of the state-of-the-art simulation, modeling, and data reduction tools to predict and study high-temperature flows. 



My research interests lie at the intersection of theoretical and computational fluid dynamics, applied physics, and computational physics, with particular emphasis on the following areas: 

1. Turbulence simulation and modeling (Hybrid RANS/LES and subgrid methods)
2. Thermal/Magneto-convection and magnetohydrodynamics
3. Hypersonics and compressible flows
