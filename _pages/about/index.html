<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Welcome! My name is Shujaut and I am a fluid dynamicist currently working as a postdoctoral associate with Prof. Daniel J. Bodony at the Center for Hypersonics and Entry Systems Studies (CHESS) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. At CHESS, I contribute towards the development of the state-of-the-art simulation and modeling tools to predict and study the thermo-poro-elastic response of Thermal Protection Systems (TPS) in high-enthalphy flow conditions during re-entry.</p> <p>Prior to this, I was hosted by Dr. Xiaojue Zhu as a Humboldt Postdoctoral Fellow in the Computational Flow Physics and Data Assimilation (ComFyDA) group at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) in Germany, where I developed a conservative, second-order finite difference solver for cartesian dynamos driven by Rayleigh BÃ©nard convection (RBC). Additionally, I worked on the physics of thermal/magneto-convective flows relevant in various geophysical and astrophysical contexts.</p> <p>Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering with minors in Astrophysics and Applied Scientific Computing from Iowa State University under the supervision of Prof. Paul Durbin.</p> <h3 id="research-interests"><strong>Research Interests</strong></h3> <p>My research interests lie at the intersection of the theoretical/computational fluid dynamics, applied physics, and computational physics, with particular emphasis on the following areas:</p> <ol> <li>Turbulence simulation and modeling (Hybrid RANS/LES and subgrid methods)</li> <li>Thermal/Magneto-convection and magnetohydrodynamics</li> <li>Hypersonics and compressible flows</li> </ol> <p><br> <br></p> </body></html>
